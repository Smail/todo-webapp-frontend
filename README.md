# Task Management Application

This a personal project primarily to learn Vue.js and PHP. This project will give you a blank page without the
(currently private) backend repository. :/

There exists a GitHub pages site for this repository, but note that any server requests were removed and replaced
by sample data, so that it can be served statically. This means that many functionalities like, task creation, deletion,
etc. don't work as intended, e.g. creating a new task doesn't save the task and clicking onto another project, resets
all tasks.

Make sure to check out the markdown support in a task's content area, the context menu and the calendar!

For anyone, who doesn't want to check out the demo site here are some GIFs of how it currently looks like:
